Hello people,

This is a Power BI dashboard of Year Over Year revenue Ride Share. Data was extracted transformed and loaded with DB browser (SQL) into Power BI. 
The main goal was to identify the peak traffic hours to introduce a demand focused Dynamic Pricing Strategy. 
Peak hours identified were between 10am and 6pm.

This was a guided project by Absent Data.
Thank you.
